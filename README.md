My name is Ogheneruona Wonder Igho.

I'm currently an undergraduate.

I joined ICT group to meet and learn with professionals who are skilled in my field. I also joined to build meaningful relationships which will help me to grow into a professional.

In the next five years, I hope to graduate from a renowned university with a degree in computer science. I also plan to complete internships and training programs to build my career and develop skills on cybersecurity.
